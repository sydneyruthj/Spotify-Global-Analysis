### Spotify is one of the worlds largest audio streaming services, with over 626 million active users and 246 million paying subscribers.
### Using data on the Top 50 charts for each of the countries in which Spotify is available, I examine how music tastes differ by global geography.

## Objective
#### The purpose of this analysis was to display how we can quantify the different music tastes of different countries. This analysis could be used by Spotify's recommendations team to examine the ways in which geography can influence their recommendation system.
## Data
#### The source of this data is [Top Spotify Songs in 73 Countries (Daily Updated)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/top-spotify-songs-in-73-countries-daily-updated/data)  from Asaniczka on Kaggle. It was created by querying the Spotify API for the top 50 songs in each country. I downloaded a copy on 9/23/24 that went back almost a year (to 10/17/23). 
#### The dataframe contains 25 columns including basic track information, where and when the song ranked on the Top 50, and descriptive data generated by Spotify. These descriptive metrics have been defined by Spotify [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features).
## Tools
#### I performed my analysis using Python in Jupyter Notebooks. I utilized a variety of tools and libraries in doing so, including a generated data profile from YData. Some libraries I utilized include pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, scipy, and statsmodels.
## Resources
#### This project is part of my curriculum for the Career Foundry Data Analytics Bootcamp. The project brief for this independent study can be found [here](https://images.careerfoundry.com/public/courses/data-immersion/A6/Data_Immersion_A6_Project_Brief.pdf).
